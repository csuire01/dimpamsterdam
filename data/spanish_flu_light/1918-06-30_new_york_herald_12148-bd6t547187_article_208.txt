LorpoN, Saturday.—The outbreak of
influenza continues to spread. At Cardiff 80 members of the Central Post
Office staff are afflicted, and the epidemic is steadily increasing in the north.
The schcols in many of the towns in
North-East Lancasläre have been closed,
and some of the overworked dectors are
reported among the victims. In the
Burnlev district many factory hands
are suffering. Most of them are girls,
and two or three cases of death are reported.
