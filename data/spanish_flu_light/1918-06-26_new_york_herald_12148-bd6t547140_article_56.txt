(FROM TIIE HERALD'S CORRESPONDENr.)
LoNpon, Tuesday.—Though thousands
of cases of influenza have occurred in
both civilian and military hospitals, reports to date suggest that the malady is
not of a serious type, and that the few
deaths notified so far have been those of
weak patients suffering from other complications.
Medical men are not perturbed by
the outbreak.Patients who go to bed
immediately they feel the symptoms, violent headaches and a general feeling of
weakness,?' said one, will recover in a
very few days. Qumine is one of the
best remedies, and, like cinnamon, it is
a good preventive.“
Treland is being heavily visited. Two
deaths in Belfast have been attributed
to the malady, and most of the schools
are closed on the advice of the health
authorities. No fewer than 4,000 workers, of one large industrial firm have
been attacked, and there are few houses
in Belfast where the disease has not
penetrated.
There seems to be no ground for the
suggestion that the new infuenza'' has
been brought home by men from the
front.
