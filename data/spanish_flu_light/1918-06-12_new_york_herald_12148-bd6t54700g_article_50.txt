Thé reports concerning the pérsonnel
of the American Red Cross Military
Hospital Nö. 1 being gassed are unföunded. There were several cases of
grippe reported last week among the
nurses and auxiliaries. Mrs. George
Munroe was absent for à fem days and
it wäs sthought there was an epidemic of
grippe in the hospital. It was afterwards
decided, however, that the sneezing and
slight. inflammätion of the eyes was
caused from handling the clothes of the
soldiers who had been gassed, but there
were no serious casés reported. No soldiers suffering from gas have been
brought to the: Neuilly hospital reéently:
Lieut.-Colonel Bingham; of the U.S.
Army Medical Cörps, who has charge
of all the American military hospitals
in the Paris zoné, told a HERAEn correspondent yésterday that practically all
of the gassed patients were being taken
to. the new Auteuil hospital, while Höspital Nö. 1 in Neuilly and Major
Blake's höspital (No. 2), were handling
the surgicäl cases. Both have greatly incréased their number öf beds. Thé
Neuilly hospital, wlich reduced its
number of beds to 700 a. few weeks ago,
now has 1,000 beds again, and Dr.
Blake's hospital is likewise filled.
