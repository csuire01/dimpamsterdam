The Academy has appointed on this
committee such eminent, medical authorities as Dr. Chauffard, Dr. Achard,
Dr. Vincent, Dr. Netter and Dr. Bezançon, whose reputation is international and iho are better qualified than
any other scientistz in the world- to
fight the insidious scourge that is now
rampant in nearly erery house in Paris.
During the sitting tlie Acadeing considered a. communication presented br
Dr. Achard on the presence of bronchopulmonary spirochatosis in the present
epidemic. Another communication, from
Dr. Patcin, dealt with the chemical analyses of blood and other fluids from
victims of the grippe. These anal'ses revealed the presence of a surprising proportion of urca. This is regarded as
evidenco of denutrition, or of akind or
intense auto-combustion of which other
symptoms are the patients' verg higir
temperature and the rapiditg with
which they become cmaciated.
Rapid Emaciation.
In regard to this rapid cmaciation,
some authorities adrise the superalimentation of the sufferers, notwithstanding their feverishness.
Dr. Netter, who has made aspecial
study of influenza erer since the terrible epidemic of 1889-1890, when people
perished by thousands, stated gesterday
that when the present-form of inilnenza
first appeared, last spring it manifested
no. specially grave characteristics. An
attack generally Insted only a few days,
thei chief symptoms being intense pain
in the head and limbs anda feverish
temperature. Since August, bowerer,
theré have been numerous complicated
developments, with acnte bronchitis,
suffocation, catarrh, pneumonia and
pleurisy of a virulent nature.
The present epidemic is particularly
contagious. It attacks several members
of the same famiiy, and the persons
nursing the patients are highly liable to
be stricken
The treatment, varies according to individual cases and can only be decided
bv. the physician attending tlie patient.
When influenza appears, the sufferer
should remain indoors and send for the
doctor immediately.
