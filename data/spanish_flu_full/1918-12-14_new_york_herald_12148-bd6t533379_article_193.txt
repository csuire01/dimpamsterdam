work. The first team to be cited for
work at Division Hospital at ChäteauThierry was composed of Major Parmetter, Captain Larron, Lientenant Carr,
Chase Warner, Miss Lyde, Miss Fitch
and Miss E. Lockwood. The second
team, which received-honorahle mention
for its difficult work in the Argonne forest, was compösed of Lieutenants Sullivan and Seeley, Misses Howden, Desk
and Curley
Major H. N. Torrey, of Detroit, who
was on duty in the Argonne, said that
it was by far the most difficult time that
the American surgeons had encountered;
especially with the Spanish “flu'' raging.
Recently. the hospital has been receiving British' prisoners of. war who
have been released from Germany. They
continue to straggle in two or three at a
time from Switzerland
The Red Cross organization has been
a great help to the hospital. It is proving to be a great pleasure to the
wounded by serving, free hot chocolate at
stated hours during the morning and
afternoon
More than 20.000 wounded soldiers
have received treatment at the hospital
during its entire existence and the staff
is: proud ofithe very low- percentage of
mortalit“, which is 1 3-5 per cent. The
Vflu,'' which was very severe in Dijon in
September and October, is accountable
forthis rate. The rate of mortality from
the strictly' surgical cases from the
front-is less than 1 per cent.
