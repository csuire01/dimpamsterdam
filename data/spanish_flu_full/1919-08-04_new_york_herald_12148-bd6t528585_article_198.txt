Losrog, Saturday.—The Rer., W.
W. Perreti, superintendent of tlie
Moravian ölission in Labrador, who
has returned from that counfry to his
hôme at Malmesbury, tells: a moving
story of harrowing experiences during
the influenza epidemic on the-Labrador coast.
At Hebron, the northernmost village,
out of a population of 220 there are but
seventy survivors. At Okak, fifty miles
south, only fifty-nine were left out of
266.All these deaths were due to
influenza, But at Nain and Hopedalee,
Mr. Perrett’s station, smallpox and
measles accounted for forty-eight
more. The influenza was brought to
Labrador bn a sailor on board the mission steamer Harmony, wllich left
about the middle of October. Later the
Rev. S.- M. Stewart, of the Colonial
and Coutinental ölission, was travelling northward by dog-sledge, and on
arriving at a sealing place near Okak
was surprised at seeing no, signs of
human hte. He looked through the
windon of a house, and was korrified to
see it full of dead Eskimos. The next
day hé went on to Okak, and found
practicaliy the same thing—nearly all
the inhabitanis dead. The mortuary
was filled with bodies, and then Eskimo
houses were used in, which to put the
dead.
