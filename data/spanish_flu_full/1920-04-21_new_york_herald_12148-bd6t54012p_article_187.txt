ToTHE Eprron or THE HERALp:—
I am always glad myself to note
some of the things that are done better!
in France than in America. The
American doughboys who. had an
opportunity to note French methods
of intensiye cultivation on French
farms and the economies achieved in
the French cuisine will probably have
taken back to the U.S.A. many valuable pointers.
It seems to us, however, that in
Four editorial onFlexibility of
French Régime'' you are a bit oversolicitous to credit French münicipal
and departmental organisation with
superiority to American methods.
During the recent influenza epidemie
in New Nork# the Heaith Officer- of
that city gave à finé example of the
flexibility of thé municipal. system
under which the Health Officer has
practically autocratic vowers in emergencies. He prevented a strike in tlie
big hotels and apartment houses, and
regulated the supply of coal. Similarly, in practically every State in
the Union the Governor“is empowered
in emiergencies to go ahead'and do the
thing that should be“ done without
waiting for legislative action. Governor Allen exercised this vower when
he called for volunteers during the
miners' strike and worked the coal
mines with volunteer crews.
If. Paris had a Health Officer endowed with the. powers exercised by
his American compeers he would get
rid of the unsanitary conditions of
Paris railway stations and streetsto
which “Aßpolonius'' called attention
in your excellentWhat Do Fou
Hunsow Rivrn
Think'' column.
