Freuch Deathroll Heavy Last Tear.
Statisticsare frequentiy emploged
to back, un some thcory, but they can
honestig be used as a basis for a dedüction, and from those of the births
and deaths in France in 1917,and 1918
it can be deduced#that an epidemic
of influenza may be considered as destructive as a modern war. The deaths
in 1917 totalled 613,148 and. in 1918
788,616: there were 343,310 birthis in
1917 and 399,041 in 1918. The excess
of deaths over births in. 1917, therefore, was 269,838; and in 1918,
389,575.
But an aualysis of, the death statistics showssthat in the last six montlie
of 1918  they“ numibered 472,539r andin
the same period öf 1917, 258,594. An
epidemic of grippe prefailed in France
during thé last half of 1918, and this
increase of 213.945 in the number of
deaths. is thought.to be due to raräges
of the disease among the civilian population
While, searching gesterday among
the ruins caused by the big fire in the
warchouses of the French Line a
Nantes, a fireman came across a grenäde and threw it into the river. From
this discorerv the inference is tliat
the fire may have been causéd by an
incendiary. The damage is now estimated at 2,000,000fr.
