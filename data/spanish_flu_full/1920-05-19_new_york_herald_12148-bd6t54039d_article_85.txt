What Mr. Davison suggests is that
Congress should appropriate 8500,
000,000 for the relief of European distress, the payments being spread over
a period of fifteen years. This mone.
was not to be a gift, but in the nature
of advances, which Mr. Davison felt
assured would be repaid. Not America
alone but all the nations, he insisted,
should share in the work of relicving
distress which constitutes Conc of the
most terrible tragedies in history.“
According to all reports, Congress,
while rcady to saddle the nation with
a crushing burden of debt to pay
bonuses to every soldier, whether ho
actually saw service in France or not
and in addition to liberal allowances
and pensions already granted, is turning a deaf car to this appeal. Reversing the patriotic motto of our
forefathers, they seem to be willing to
give “billions for tribute, but not one
penny for defence'’—ot one penn)
for the averting of threatened epidemic and the substantial expression
of sympathy with the sufferers from
a world catastrophe.
It is to be hoped that the larger
and deeper spirit of true Americanism
will declare itself loudly cnough to
awaken these Congressmen and cause
them to take sober second thoughit
before discarding tho opportunity
which the cmergeney presents.
