After holding a consultation in London with
Dr. H. B. de Marville, of Paris, Mr. Moncure Robinson, who, a short time ago, was
dangerously ill and who is still in a critical
condition, has decided to come to Paris,
which he loves and where he has many
friends. At Dr. de Marville's suggestion, it
was for a while, contemplated to transport
Mr. Robinson from London to Paris by aero
plane, in order to minimise the fatiguc of the
crossing and of the journey by train. This
plan, however, was eventually abandoned.
