As. if sthe war and. its conssquences weré
nöt ills chough for this generation, new and
strange maladies keépadding their quota of
affliction as each winter comes round. Last
year it Was encephali.is of the lethargie
variety, and now another epidemic has made
its äppcarance in Paris, Which, though not
serious in its cönsequences, is suffiei ntlzpainful while it lasts to. justify the dreadfname that lias, been given to it by learned
doctors—Myoclonie Encephalitis.
The prémonitory syrptom of this new discase, wlich appears ta be widely prevalent
in Paris just now, is hiccough—not ordinary
hiccough, which yields to well-known homely
remedies, but a persistent; stubhorn spasm o
tlie diaphragm which lasts for several days.
The. patientris sö shaken after these prolonged
fits that he is left in a state of weakness
differing little from #that which follows a
serious illness.
Dr. Dufour, of the Höpital Broussais, who
has attended a large number, of cases of
Myoclonic Encéphalitis, says that the malady
is undoubtedly of an infectious character, in
view of the fever which accompanies its beFinnings. Whila admitting that it is not
malignant, the physician warns those affected
not t0 treat it lighily, but torlake thie usua
précautions, as complicätions may ensue.
