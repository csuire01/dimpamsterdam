To rur Entron or guE HERArn:—
Barcelona, Spain.
I.sco in reading in the Nrm Yonx
Hrnarn that you call the malady now
raging“Spanish influenza.! I am very
sorry to tell you that this iliness has
nothing at all to do with Spain. I
comes not only from France, but from
all the countries engaged in the war.
Of the#whole world Spain is the least
punished by this terrible disease. I hope
Fou will be so kind as tochange the
name of this epidemie,a name that has
only been given bn the enemies of Spain.
