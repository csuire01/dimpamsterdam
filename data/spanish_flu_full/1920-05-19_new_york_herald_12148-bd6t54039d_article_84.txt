There is perhaps no man better informed as to#the actual conditions of
Central and Eastern Europe to-day
than Mr. Heury P. Davison, Chairman of the Red Cross Administrative
Council. As the result of close and
careful study of the needs of the famine-stricken and disease-ravaged peoples of Austria, Poland, Serbia and
Roumania by Am√©rican Red Cross
commissiens, he sums up the need as
one of such vastness and urgency in
the matter of medical relief, food,
clothing and aid in various other ways
to the restoration of normal life in
chese countries, that it is entirely
beyond the resources of any private
organisation and one calling for goverument help on a large scale
Every physician and every publicist
who has given any attention to the
history of che spread of epidemies, especially of epidemics arising from
famine conditions, will agree with Mr.
Davison in the warning he sounds regarding the risk of such an epidemic
spreading to the United States, if
not checked at its source by proper
sanitary and hygicnic measures. This
consideration surely should help to
clinch the humanitarian appeal.
