Paris, October 12, 1918.
To. run Enrron or rir Hrnarp:—
As one of the medical personnel of
tho A.E. F. I am most interested in the
health and welfare of. the troops of our
allied forces, as well as tho people of
Franco.
I. was therefore pleased to rend your
editorial in this. morning's paper. Just
at this stage of the World War, we, and
the. peoplerof all France should be willing to do all in our power to consorve
tlie mihtary strength öf our forces, and
of course, the civil population of. France.
After the loss of mäng lives and much
property success seems within our prasp
if we but pursue our offensive most
vigorously.
God knons our men are exposed to
enough dangers in actual warfare without adding tö them tliese cpidemics,
pandemies I might say, of Influenza.
Therefore, we aud the people of Frauce,
should be gladly willing to take all steps
necessary to prevent the spread of this
disease.
