Sir. David Henderson, dircctor-generalof the League, said to-dayfthe
Red Cross League is charged with. the
serious responsibility ofprotecting#the
public health-in this crisis, the people öf
she. varioüs nations must-realize that
Che fight is their own and that the
League is acting as their instrument.
The Leaguewill be put to tlie severest
test at the very beginning of its existenée. We believe that with the aid of
che Governments and with the aid of
wroluntary national societies supported
by the people, weican control and limit
che spread of the epidemic.
Situation Serious.
The situation in Eastern and Southern Europe is too serious to be coped
with by any single Governmenti or by
any yoluntary society. The Red Cross
Leagne affords a medium through which
the governments and the. voluntary societies can co-operate, and hy means of
which efforts may be co-ordinated! The
League hasat its disposal the assistance
of the mmost expert: medical advisers,
Erained by practical experience in combating täphus. It has ready the help of
the trained persönnel of the British Red
Cross and the American Red Cross, both
of which societies have already units in
the field, and it can call foraid upon
the other Red Cross. Societies, members
of the. League. Ié will be able to utilize.
under expert direction, certain medical
and other supplies now in Europe, of the
Allied Governmeuts and the-hational
voluntary societies
The League is prepared to undertake
the strategical direction of the campaign It the Leagus is requested to
undertake this work. b###the respective
Governments, it will offer the opportunity to the people to show, throughr their
national Red Cross Societies, their pracZical interest in the common welfare.
The future, will depend upon the response made to that appeal. The League
has no thought of over-riding national
societies; on the contrary, it secks t0
co-operate with them andto develop and
stimulate them.
