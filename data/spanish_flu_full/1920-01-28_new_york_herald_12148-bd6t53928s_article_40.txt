there hare been only 1,712 new cases
of influenza reported during the past
twenty-four hours does not gire any
satisfaction to the liealth authorities,
for they claim that physicians have
nôt reported during Saturday and Sunday. These reports will be reccived at
the Board of Health to-day and will
gire a big jump to tho total of cases
during the next twenty-four hours.
Dr. Copeland states that the disease
this gear is of a much milder form than
that which swept the country last gear.
as is eridenced by the fewer number
of deatlis. Howerer, the epidemic is
sweeping the countrg from the Atlantic to the Pacific, haring appeared in
California during the past forty-eight
hours, and being prevalent now in
twenty-one States.
The iliness of screral atfendants in
the magistrates' courts has halted mauy
legal proceedings. Sis kecpers and
fiftz'-one prisoners hare been removed
from the Tombs to Belleruc as victims
of the epidemic.
Haif a million dollars has been appropriated. br Congress for rescarch
work in combating influenza through
