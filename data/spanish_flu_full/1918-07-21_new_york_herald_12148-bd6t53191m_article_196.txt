(FROM THE HERALD'S GORRESPONDENT.
Lorpon, Saturday.—More than 600
American women in all parts of Great
Britain are now enrolled in the Care
Committee of the American Red. Cross.
The headquarters of this committee,
which is at 154 New Bond street, Londön, is in charge of Mrs. Robert P.
Skinner, wife of the Consul-General
and there are sub-committees in twenty
cities in England, Scotland, Wales and
Treland.
The Care Committee is immediately
notified of the arrival in hospital of an
American soldier. Every such soldier is
visited at least once a week. More than
5,000 Americans in hospitals have received personal calls from the women of
the Care Committee during the past
few weeks. The visitors make a, special
effort to get the men into touch with
their relatives and friends at home.
During the recent prevalence of influenza in England the women of the
Care Committee in a single week visited
more than 800 American soldiers suffering from the ailment.
