most rabid partisans and most unscrupulous agents, Brockdorff-Rantzau and
Scheidemann and David, the  Internationalists'' have set to work to prevent
the conclusion of peace on the Allies'
terms, which are woefully inadequate.
Germany is to be saved from punishment. That is the underlying purpose of
the epidemic of strikes in France and
England, the bomb outrages all over the
United States, the revolutionary propaganda in all the civilized countries.
We now begin to see the enormity of
our error in making the conclusion ot
peace a subordinate matter, and in beginning to demobilize the Allied armies
before the peace terms had been even
outlined. That, however, is the past. It.
is the present that calls for attention
and vigorous action. The peoples who
stoically made such appalling sacrifices
to defeat the enemy of civilization will
certainly not. permit their victory to be
nullified and their sacrifices brought to
nought by a band of anarchists in the
enemyâ€™s service. All that they need is a
leader with firmness and decision. 11
the Governments are incapable of providing such leadership, let them turn
over the work to the men who defeated
Germany on the Marne, on the Somme,
in the Argonne. We are stillat war
with Germany, The logical conclusion is,
in M. Clemenceau's words, to make
war.? The one certain method of restoring industrial peace in the Allied countries is to compel Germany, by.arms if
need be and at once, to accept the
Allies' terms. Decisive action to that end
will reduce not only Germany but her
army propagandists and revolutionaries
abroad to impotency.
