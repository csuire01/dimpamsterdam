WAnsAw, March 25.â€”A member of, the
American Red Cross Mission who has
just returned here after an eight-day
tour of the Polish-Bolshevist and PolishUkrainian fronts reports little military
activity, but widespread and heartrending desolation and suffering among the
populations. In addition to famine, the
people are perishing from an extensive
epidemic of typhus. There is also considerable smallpox and trachoma
Fortunately the field for relief wor
is extended daily in the new areas opened
up by the Polish troops. In the course
of the trip the party travelled about
2,000 miles and visited some twenty
cities and villages. They found that
Mr. Hoover's agents were making an
excellent distribution of the flour shipped from America. This relief the Red
Cross party is supplementing with supplies of condensed milk, medicines and
clothing. Facing the awful extent of
ihe need and its heartrending poignang, the dominant impression was of the
utter inadequacy of present supplies to
meet the situation.
