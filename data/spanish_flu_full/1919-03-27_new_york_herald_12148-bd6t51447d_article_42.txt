(SPECIL TELEGRAM TO THE HIERALD.)
Wans.w, Tuesday.—The American
Red Cross Mission to Poland to-day
completed an eight-day tour of inspection of Eastern and South-Eastern Poland, during which it travelled 1,500
miles and distributed supplies of food,
clothing and medicines to twenty cities,
towns and villages.
Typhus was found ererywhere, but it
was cpidemic mainly in the- small isolated villages cut off from the channels
of transportation. Smallpox and trachoma were not so prevalent, but grave
dangers of an epidemic threatened
ihere the victims of all these diseases
lived in the same rooms with undernourished persons who had not get been
attackéd.
The greatest suffering and destitution
were found in Pinsk, 200 miles east of
Warsaw, in the unhealthy Pripet
marshes. Here were 500 cases of typhus
among the population, which, in the
last four gears, has been reduced from
50,000 to 25,000. The people generally
were living under the most unsanitary,
disease-breeding conditions, and hunger
had stalked into every home.
