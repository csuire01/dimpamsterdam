varied assortment
was provided for
the delectation of
Parisians Festerday. The day
broke clear and
cold; but before
tho morning had
far advanced tho
sky became overcast and a cold north-west wind
sprang up, bringing döwn the seré and yellow
joaves in showers. About noon thero was a
swift and sudden hailstorm that played its merry
tattoo on the window panes. Thereafter flashes
of brilliant sunshine alternated with showers
that suggested April. Only the venturesome and
the busy people appeared outdoors, and the
public gardens were practically deserted. The
outer dank, damp and chilly unpleasantness inelined peopie's minds to indoor comfort and
indoor occupation. By the same token, it impressed on thei the intolerable conditions sug.
gestive of Spanish flu' caused by the coal
shortage. So perhaps something will be done
to correct fhat evil.
