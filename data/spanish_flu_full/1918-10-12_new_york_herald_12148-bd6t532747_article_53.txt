oven tbe symptoms of pleurisy hare been
observed, with a tendency to purulency.
In the present cpidemic some cases of
tho intestinal form of the malady have
beon observed, but the most numerous
assume tho pulmonary form. When the
Bulmonary congestion is very intense,
the victims become cyanosed and even
assumo a blackish huc. This has, incorrectly, spread the ides among tho public

The general prognosis of the ordinary
form of influenza is very benign. The
grovity resides in the complications.
During the 1889-90 epidemié about 5,500
persons succumbed to infiuenza in Paris,
and there were pulmonary complications in most cäses. Last week 192
dleaths were recorded, that
mortality
being lower than the mortality of 1889.
At the same time 400 cases of influenza
were reported daily, as compared with
1,000 in 1889, when twosthirds of the
Parisian population were affected. The
cmission of a large quantity of urine
and the appearance of abundant perspiration generally foreshadow the end
