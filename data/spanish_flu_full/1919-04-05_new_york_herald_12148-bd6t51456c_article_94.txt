The greatest danger from an attack
of the grip, or influenza, is affer the
scute stage is over, when the lowered
vitality makes tho system an easy pres
for any germ disease to#which it is cxposed. The debility resulting from an
attack of the grip is so versistent thaß,
if the blood is not built up and the
strength restored, in may last for
months and years. That this is unnecessary is shown by the experience of
Mrs. Laura M. Van Scoy, who lives at
No. 204 Thorpe street, Danbury, Conn.
Shs says:—
I had a severs attack of grip, and
before I had fully recovered rheumatism set in and termested me for three
months. I was in a badly run-dogn
state. Soon after it began I was so lame
for a week that I could hardly walk
It kept growing steadily worse and
pretty scon I actually couldn't walk.
At last I had to gire up completely and
for three weeks I was obliged to keep
to my bed. My kuees were so stiff I
couldn't bend them and. iny hands wero
perfectly helpless. Then the pains began
to threaten my hcart and thoroughly
alarmed me.
