We are asked on all hands for information about Spanish influenza, which is
prevalent, it is said, in Paris. We can
anly reply that, according to the opinion
of authoritative d√∂ctors, there is, properly speaking, no influenza epidemie in
Paris. Enquiries made yesterday morning in a large city hospital showed that
there were only four cases of influenza.
Aniong the civil population some cases
are reported, but up to the present there
has been nothing which can be compared
with the great epidemic of 1889
