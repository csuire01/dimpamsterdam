For a long time past now atmospherie
changes have been accused of giving
birth to influenza epidemics. In 1889,
during the epidemic an altogether inexplicable rise in the barometric pressure
was recorded in Paris. In Berlin and
Vienna it was remarked that the epidemie coincided with hazy damp weather
and an abnormal rise of the barometer.
In Warsaw theradvent of the colder weather brought about a marked decrease
in the disease.
As regards contagion, says Professor
Widal, it has been observed that the
malady is usually rampant in schools,
the postal service and large industrial
establishments, where the occupants are
constantly in contact with the outside
world, while prisons and asylums, where
the contrary. is the case, seldom suffer
much.
At the Hötel Dieu where five cases
were admitted theflu'' is now making
a tour of the establishment.
Disease Is Contagious.
Most medical authorities, therefore,
are convinced of the contagious nature
of the disease, which can be propagated
not only by direct contact, but through
the agency of water, the air, objects and
animals. The rapidity of diffusicn is
greater than is the case with any other
malady.
There is no real curs, says Professor
Widal. Recovery is generally spontencous. Sulphate of quinine, antipyrine and aconite are principally emplöred. The first namedl in doses of a
gramme or 75 centigrammes, tends to
ward off the malady. Antipyrine calms
the headache which accompanies it and
also alleviates the sense of fatigue. Pulmonary complications may be avoided
by- pectorals and similar specifics.
