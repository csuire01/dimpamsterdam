Usually Appears in Summer.
True influenza usually appears during the winter months. On the contrary,the so-called Spanish influenza
usuallyappears in summer months,
reaching its higlest point when the fly
is most active. The summer variety is
no new-comer. In war times it is more
easily propagated, perhaps, because of
the less effective organization of sanitation
TAs to treatment, I favor first of all,
the highest precautions of the- kind prescribed as preventive measures. Thus,
where this is done, you will, invariably,
notice a diminished number of cases,
perhaps none at all
Apart. from this, the simplest treatment is rest in bed, keep warm and an
initial purge of three grains of calome
(I prefer this, as it acts as an intestinal
antiseptic); then castor oil and then
small doses of quinine and salol three
times a day. If there is a sharp colic,
some form of opiate tablet may be used
under the direction of a medical man.
