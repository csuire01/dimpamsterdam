The present cases of influenza, howsver, resemble in a certain measure those
of the 1889 epidemic: the sudden attack,
the high temperature which rises to
40 degrees and even more; the patientâ€™s
face becomes red; he has a pronounced
feeling of exhaustion and a violent headsche. All this disappears in three or
fohr days at most after abundant perspiration. But those who have been attacked by the influenza continue to feel
run down for several days, and sometimes
for two or three wecks
The serious complications which accounted for the gravity of the 1889 epidemichave not yetrbeen observed. Only
a.few cases of vomiting or enteritis and
pulmionary localizations have been reported, and for# the most part these have
been slight.
This is all that can be said about influenza in Paris, and it is not possible to
say Whether the cases already reported,
Which are at present isolated, will be followed by a real epidemic. It is hardly
probable that this will be the case. The
1889 epidemic began right away. It attained simultaneously a large number of
Parisians. Then the initial centres of
the malady became merged, and the epidemic assumed a general character. The
present influenza does not appear to have
created centres. The cases seem to have
developed quite isolatedly
The evolution of the malady itself indicates the method of treatment. The
attack comes to an end by the patient
perspiring abundantly. As the best
therapeutic is that which helps nature,
the best treatment will be to produce
perspiration. This is easily done by giving a cachet of 30 centigrammes of
pyramidon, and ten minutes later
