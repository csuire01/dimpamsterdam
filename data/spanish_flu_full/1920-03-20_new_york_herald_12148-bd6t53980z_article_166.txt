Hunger Rampant.
Tliere is an old saying that when a
man goes hungry one day he will lie,
the second he will steal ard the third
he will kill. Thé people of. Germany
are now in thie second stage, rapidly
spproaching ihe third. Never before
has there been such an epidemic of
theft and burglary in Berlin as at
present. The ordinary workman receives from 1,000 bö 1,500 marks a
month, get with butter at 22 and 30
marks. à pound, eggs at 24 marks a
dozen und milk at 5 marks a litre,
when obtainable, he must live on
scarcely more than a crust of bread,
wbich admittedly is no incentive to
work. Living in the very best hotel
in Berlin I have often gone hungry.
At ths Motel Adion a man happened.to
leave a,few scraps of potatoes on his
plate, and a woman having all the
sarks of. gentility walked over to the
table, and after asking his permission,
Carried them off in a paper napkin.
The incident passed without any particular comment.
