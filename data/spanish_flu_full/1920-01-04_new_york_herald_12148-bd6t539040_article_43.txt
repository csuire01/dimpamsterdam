But it is better to avoid grippe than
to have to treat it. It will be aroided
by abstaining from assemblies, such as
cincmas, „theätres and
other public
places; by pulverizing the nostrils
with oil containing 5 per cent. of
gomenol; by good hygiene, by abstaining from excess, of any kind, and,
ahore all, by avoiding contact with
people suffering from grippe
In short, there is eridently grippe
in Paris;; but until the present time it
is localised and has not an epidemic
character. It. is moring-in isolated
centresand it is very probable that
even if it. becomes extended a little,
we shall not 'sée the grippe of 1918-19,
which prevailed throughout the world
and madle so gréat a number of vietims.
