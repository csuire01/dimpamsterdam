Thursday.
The enemy's aggressiveness has been
confined this week to heary bursts of
artillery fire. His batteries have been
very energetic during the night around
Tpres and against the Allied trenches
defending the Flemish hills. His infantry, however, is apparently tod weak or
dispirited to give any exhibitions of hostility, and is content to hold the defences.
If the Fourth German Army tries
again to advance from Kemmel against
Vpres and the hills overlooking it, fresh
divisions will undoubtedly be sent
through these weary trench garrisons if
the latter are not relieved beforehand.
Some of the trench garrisons have been
depleted by influenza, and these men
who had been sent to medical camps are
only just beginning to return in any
number.
In spite of the severe cannonade of
the Fourth and Sixth German Armies.
north of La Bass√©e, a rast amount of
constructional work has been carried out
behind their front, which embraras al
the Flanders defences.
