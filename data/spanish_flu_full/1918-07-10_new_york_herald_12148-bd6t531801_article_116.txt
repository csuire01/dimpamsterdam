The general opinion on the subject of
the Spanish influenza'' is that it is
little more than a new name for the
grippe.
Some United States Army officers of
the Medical Cörps were seén yesterday
by a Hrnarp correspondent, and all said
that they häd seen no cases of this
curious kind offlu'“ in the military
hospitals and that from all they had
read or heard ofrit they would suggest
the grippe treatment.
A Parisian who is just recovering from
What was diagnozed the “Spanish flu“
by a. Russian döctor, and who does not
care to have his name mentioned, said
Festerday:“My throat was curiöusly
affected and T ached from my head tomy
#feet, büt I felt#that I was only having
the grippe, though my physician said it
was the fflu.“ However, he gave me tle
same medicine as for grippe and I should
merely call it a new name for the
grippe.
 Everybodyis tired and run down
after so much war relief work and being
on a constant strain on account of the
war, so the grippe might affect different
persons in different ways, according to
their physical strength and theréfore
maké them feel as if tliev were having
some new kind of grippe. My doctor says
that there is no cause for alarm orer
an epidèmie in Paris.“
