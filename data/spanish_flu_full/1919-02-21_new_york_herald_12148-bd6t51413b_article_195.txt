(SPECTAL TELEGRAM T0 THE HERALD.)
Lowpon, Thursday.â€”Deaths from influenza, as revcaled by a return of the
Registrar-General issued last- night,
show an abrupt and alarming increase.
These figures cover the week ending
February 15.
In London 273 persons died from influenza, as against 99 in the previous
week. It will be instructive. to assocatesthese totals with those 6f each of
the preceding eleven weeks, wflich take
one back to the-last epidemic. They
were: 58, 33, 43, 68, 65, 95, 186, 322,
660.-942 and 1,178.
Thus it will-be seen that last week's
figures are slight in comparison with
those of the bad time in November.
