Tö rur Entrox or rus HEnarp:—
I understand that you publish letters
for the soldiers in your little publication,
and would be pleased if you would insert
the enclosed letter address to Robert C.
Bennett.
My reasons for asking this request is
that on account of a wound he received
July 31, and his removal to a Paris hospital, and then to his present address,
his mail has nct-followed him, and he has
noß received a single piece of mail from
July 15—Oct. 5, when he wrote me last,
and I would like to get some word to 3
very homesick boy.
