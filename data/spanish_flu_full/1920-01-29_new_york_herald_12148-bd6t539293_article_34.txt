While not going so far as to aver
that grippe is reallg a form ol bubenic
plague, Dr. Folleg points out that the
same serum may be successfullz- used
in thc same group of diseases
His experiments were begun on himself, following a laboratory accident
in October, 1918, by which he innoculated himself with the influenza microbe. He demonstrated that the
anti-plague serum, which acts as a preventive of the plagnc, cures the grippe.
Incidentally, Dr. Folley declares
that encephalitis lethargica or sleepyheadedness is no laughing matter,
but u scrious phase in an influcnza
attack, one frequently resulting fatallg. So far noba singie case has
been lost by Dr. Folleg' and ho regards
his remedy as sovereign.
The Polish Goverument has- called
Ã¶n Dr. Folley to light the cpidemic
which is spreading rapidlz in that
country, and he will leave for Poland
shortlg. His experiments are being
much discussed also in England, Sweden and Germang.
Influcnza is still spreading in Paris,
says the*Temps, but although the
cases are numerous they are much less
serious generallg- than was the case
last gear. So far it has not been necessary to set aside spegial wards in
the hospitals, but isolation is prac-
tised. Measurcs have been taken by
the health authorities to cope with the
epidemie should it aitain larger proportions. Much more alarming is the
spread of diphtheria, especially in the
more congested quarters.
