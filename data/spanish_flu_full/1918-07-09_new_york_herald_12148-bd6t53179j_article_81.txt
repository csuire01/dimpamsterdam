Spanish flu’’its history and treatment—is discussed in the Petit Journal'’ by Professor Fernand Widal, member of the French Academy of Medicine.
The epidemic, which started in Spain,
presents the same characteristics and
the same rapidity of diffusion as the influenza uf 1889, which started in the
chief towns of Russia and spread rapidly throughout a great part of the world.
In 1889-1890 the disease in some places
spread with the rapidity of the fastest
express trains. The malady in its course
usually follows the main lines of communication, attacking the largest towus,
whence it is propagated to secondary
centres and finally to the most isolated
localities.
