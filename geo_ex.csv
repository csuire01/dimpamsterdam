with shivering, painful fehrile lassitude

rises rapidly to a high degree, which may
aitain 40.ödeg. Cent. Sometimes this
fever is accompanied by delirium. When
the malady is definitely manifested the

reddening of the skin, the headache increases, the patients dread noise and
light; all their muscular masses become
painful; their tongues are covered with
an opaline slime, their thirst is quenchless and their appetite nil.
In somo instances bleeding from the
nose is observed. Almost always the
urine contains albumine, but in a modcrate qusntity. The spleen often increnses in volume.
The. illness lasts from four to eight
days. Its decline is progressive and is
generally preceded by profuse perspiration, sometimes also by dangerous diarrheea or of the appearence of herpes on

may be very lengthy. Even in so-called

In realliy, one cannot yet Speak of an
epidemic. The fact is that in the city
chere have been noted isolated centres
of a disease which has all the appearances of grippe; but those
ccntres are
separated by large spaces
in ihich the
discäse is not preralent.
And as these
centres have Gxisted for
aboüt threo
weeks, withoub becoming general,
There.are grounds forthe hope that
the discase will remain localised.
What are the fentures of these centres?
Thefirst cases which appeared preveuted the intestinal form of grippe.
Such cases are ordinarily very serious. They are accompanied by an
abundant diarrhca, requiring frequent. visits to the water-closet, by
rather violent colic und, sometimes,
by the presence of blood in the stools.
A second varicty takes the pulmonar
form. It begins generally by a sore
hroat and arather intense, fever. This
fever
of falling at the end of
chrec or four days, continues; the respiration peomes embarrassed; the expectoration contains blcod, and on
auschlation sigus of broncho-pneumonia are-perceived.
In athirdscase, pulmonary congestion is predominant. It may be rather
intense äud be a great obstacle to the
breathing, so much so indeed that the
lips become blue and ihe face has a
purplish appcaränce. It is these cases
which, falsely interpreted, bave causec
certain incompeteht persons to belicre

A. fourth
varicty is accompanied by
heryous troubles, delirium, somnolence,
agitation, stiffness of the back of the

suggest
meningitis:
But sd far the affection has not
shown itself in its very serious forms.
The cases which the doctors hare met
hare remained benign for the most

rise in temperature, which falls at che

73,new_york_herald_12148-bd6t539785_article_51,article,1920-03-18,"At a time when the epidemic of
business is transforming some of the
most ancient hostelries in Paris into
commercial houses it is pleasant to
note that one of the oldest and most
famous, the Hotel du Rhin, in the
place Vendöme, has just reopened. its
doors. It is owing to the initiative
of a Frenchman that it has been conserved in its charming originalit.
while being enlarged and remodelled.
The hotel occupies Nos. 4 and 6 of
the famous square erected by order
of Louis XIV., who instructed Mansart to draw up plans by which 1
should be octagonal in shape with uniform buildings. The place'' was
opened on the site of the residence o
the Duc de Vendöme, grandson of the
first duke, who was the son of Henri
IV. and Gabrielle d'Estrées. Part o
the ground occupied by the Couvent
des Capucines was also used by the
architect. Louis XIV., of whom a
statue was erected in the centre of the
Splace'' in 1699, gave over the buildings as residences to his farmersgeneral, and Nos. 4 and 6 were occupied by Aubert, one of the chief tax
controllers of the King. It afterwards
became the home of the politician Le
Peletier de Saint-Fargeau and his
daughier, Princesse de Chimay, known
at Court as“La Dame de Volupté.'
The nephew of the princess was the
Revolution hero, Le Peletier de SaintFargeau, who, after voting in favor
of the execution of. Louis XVI., was
assassinated by Päris, a Royal Guard
at the Palais Royal. His bloodchvered body was laid naked in the
place Vendöme, where Louis XIV.'s
statue had been thrown down. Followed by a huge crowd the body was
then conveyed to the Panthéon.
The place Vendöme has retained its
original aspect, except that the statue
of the“Roi Soleil'' kas been replaced
by Napoleqn’s Grand Army column—
which continues popularly, but incorrectly, to be called the Vendöme
column. One corner of the square
narrowly escaped total destruction
during the war by. a Gotha bomb,
which did considerable damage.
From the early days of its existence
to the time it was closed as a result
of the war the Hotel du Rhin shelterec
at various timnes most of the crowned
heads of Europe as well as a long list
of celebrities. In the earlv ’sixties
Prince Louis Napoleon lived in what
are now rooms 8, 9 and 10, and his
furniture is still kent in these rooms,
just as it was the day he left. King
Albert of the Belgians stopped there
before the war; and John Jacob Astor
made his domicile at the hotel, as did
Count Potocki and many others. Even
the Tron Chancellor of Germany lived
under its roof at one time. Probably
there evolved some of the plans which
in after Fears burned out in a way
that Bismarck did not foresee","[('Paris', 'GPE'), ('the Hotel du Rhin', 'ORG'), ('Vendöme', 'PERSON'), ('Frenchman', 'NORP'), ('Nos', 'PERSON'), ('4 and 6', 'CARDINAL'), ('Louis XIV', 'PERSON'), ('Mansart', 'PERSON'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Duc de Vendöme', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Henri', 'GPE'), ('IV', 'GPE'), (""Gabrielle d'Estrées"", 'PERSON'), ('Louis XIV.', 'PERSON'), ('Splace', 'PERSON'), ('1699', 'DATE'), ('Nos', 'PERSON'), ('4 and 6', 'CARDINAL'), ('Aubert', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Le\nPeletier de Saint-Fargeau', 'FAC'), ('Princesse de Chimay', 'ORG'), ('Court', 'ORG'), ('Le Peletier de SaintFargeau', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Louis XVI', 'PERSON'), ('Päris', 'ORG'), ('Royal Guard', 'ORG'), ('the Palais Royal', 'FAC'), ('Vendöme', 'PERSON'), ('Louis XIV', 'PERSON'), ('Panthéon', 'NORP'), ('Vendöme', 'PERSON'), ('Soleil', 'ORG'), ('kas', 'ORG'), ('Napoleqn’s Grand Army', 'ORG'), ('Vendöme', 'GPE'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Gotha', 'ORG'), ('the early days', 'DATE'), ('the Hotel du Rhin', 'ORG'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Prince Louis Napoleon', 'FAC'), ('8', 'CARDINAL'), ('9', 'DATE'), ('10', 'DATE'), ('the day', 'DATE'), ('Albert', 'PERSON'), ('Belgians', 'ORG'), ('John Jacob Astor', 'PERSON'), ('Potocki', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Fears', 'PERSON'), ('Bismarck', 'ORG')]"

The epidemic, which started in Spain,
presents the same characteristics and
the same rapidity of diffusion as the influenza uf 1889, which started in the
chief towns of Russia and spread rapidly throughout a great part of the world.
In 1889-1890 the disease in some places
spread with the rapidity of the fastest
express trains. The malady in its course
usually follows the main lines of communication, attacking the largest towus,
whence it is propagated to secondary
centres and finally to the most isolated
localities.","[('Spanish', 'NORP'), (""the Petit Journal'"", 'ORG'), ('Fernand Widal', 'PERSON'), ('the French Academy of Medicine', 'ORG'), ('Spain', 'GPE'), ('1889', 'DATE'), ('Russia', 'GPE'), ('1889-1890', 'DATE')]"

changes have been accused of giving
birth to influenza epidemics. In 1889,
during the epidemic an altogether inexplicable rise in the barometric pressure
was recorded in Paris. In Berlin and
Vienna it was remarked that the epidemie coincided with hazy damp weather
and an abnormal rise of the barometer.
In Warsaw theradvent of the colder weather brought about a marked decrease
in the disease.
As regards contagion, says Professor
Widal, it has been observed that the
malady is usually rampant in schools,
the postal service and large industrial
establishments, where the occupants are
constantly in contact with the outside
world, while prisons and asylums, where
the contrary. is the case, seldom suffer
much.
At the Hötel Dieu where five cases
were admitted theflu'' is now making
a tour of the establishment.
Disease Is Contagious.
Most medical authorities, therefore,
are convinced of the contagious nature
of the disease, which can be propagated
not only by direct contact, but through
the agency of water, the air, objects and
animals. The rapidity of diffusicn is
greater than is the case with any other
malady.
There is no real curs, says Professor
Widal. Recovery is generally spontencous. Sulphate of quinine, antipyrine and aconite are principally emplöred. The first namedl in doses of a
gramme or 75 centigrammes, tends to
ward off the malady. Antipyrine calms
the headache which accompanies it and
also alleviates the sense of fatigue. Pulmonary complications may be avoided
by- pectorals and similar specifics.","[('1889', 'DATE'), ('Paris', 'GPE'), ('Berlin', 'GPE'), ('Vienna', 'GPE'), ('Warsaw', 'GPE'), ('the Hötel Dieu', 'FAC'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('75', 'CARDINAL')]"

of the 1889 epidemic: the sudden attack,
the high temperature which rises to

desolate spot, but the hospitals are so
well organized and the wounded soldiers so well cared for that the location
makes little difference. The camp comprises seven hospitals with an average
of 1,200 beds each in wooden barracks

size with the same outlook of more
barracks.

by the hospitals at Mars and Tesves.
The number of wounded admitted from
April when the camp was first organisedto November was 30,650. The most
that it has cared for at the time has
been 20,000, which was ten per cent.
of all the beds in Francs and one-sixt
of all beds except in the field hospitals.
Colonel Ford, the commanding offioer, told a Hraann correspondent that
the death rate had been exceptionally
low and that diphtherih had been the

kept it from spreading and he felt that
it had been well handled. The American

have been clösed, and püblic gatherings
of all kinds prohibited.
This dction follewed tlie advice of
Surgeon - General Blue, of the Püblic

said that in his opinion the only way te
meet the epidemic was for the authorities in infected localities to closeall
public gatherings and assembly-places.

From various sections of the country reports are made that a vaccine has
been discovered for the prevention of infiuenza. Until the value of such an agent
has been fullg determined by careful and
Oxhaustive investigatiön, which will not
be completed during the present epidemic, it would, for various reasons,
seem unwise and improper to reccmmend it for general use.?
Dr. Doty also insists on the sanitary
aspect of the question, and declares
that:—Duringan official visit#to Russig some years ago I found inthe overcronding, poverty, and dirt a very satisfactory explanationwhy the epidemic of

which efforts may be co-ordinated! The

Erained by practical experience in combating täphus. It has ready the help of
the trained persönnel of the British Red

of which societies have already units in
the field, and it can call foraid upon
the other Red Cross. Societies, members
